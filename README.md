# Spice Stoke

Live website link  https://spice-stoke-service.web.app/

## Project Detail
* This project is based on SPA(Single Page Application). For this I use react router. In this project I implement email, password and google authentication which is offerd by firebase. I use active link
for understanding which route we are. 

* I use private route in this project. If anyone want to go any private page he/she should login or register first. I also implement forgot password link. So you can reset your password if forgot.

* I use Firebase hooks for implementing authentication. I also handle authentication error. When anyone give wrong email or password it will show error.

* This website is responsive for dekstop, mobile and tablet. For responsive design I use react bootstrap.

* I set 404 page if anyone want to go unknown route.
